# reproject grid to h3 with interpolation

one day it would be nice to automate this enough to go from a table of `midpoint | area | value` to `h3 | value` with appropriate ring sizes etc. picked

at the moment it is not that

# caveats

some accuracy will be lost as hexagons are not rectangular. but h3 are useful enough that i personally don't care
